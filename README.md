# Review-on-UCTP-algorithms
A research-driven implementation of hybrid genetic algorithms (FGASA, FGARI, FGATS) for solving the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP), integrating fuzzy logic and metaheuristics like Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search to optimize complex academic scheduling under hard and soft constraints.
